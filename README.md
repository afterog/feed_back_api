# feedback_rest_api


This GitHub repository contains a RESTful API for collecting feedback. The API is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

The repository contains the following important files and directories:

models directory: This directory contains the MongoDB models used to store the feedback data.

routes directory: This directory contains the Express routes that handle incoming requests and return responses. The routes are responsible for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting feedback data.

app.js file: This file is the entry point of the application. It sets up the Express app, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines the routes for the API.

package.json file: This file lists the dependencies for the project and provides information about the project, such as the name and version.

.env file: This file contains environment variables used by the application, such as the MongoDB connection string.

This is a simple but well-structured RESTful API for collecting feedback. The code uses Express and MongoDB to provide a scalable and maintainable solution for collecting feedback.

To pull this code and run it on your local machine, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/afteralexxo/feedback_rest_api.git

Change into the repository directory: Run the following command to change into the repository directory:
bash
Copy code
cd feedback_rest_api

Install the dependencies: Run the following command to install the dependencies:
Copy code
npm install

Set up the environment variables: Create a file named .env in the root of the project and set the values of the environment variables. You can find the required environment variables in the app.js file. For example, to set the MongoDB connection string, you would add the following line to the .env file:
bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/feedback_api

Start the server: Run the following command to start the server:
sql
Copy code
npm start


This will start the server and you can test the API by sending HTTP requests to it. The base URL for the API will be http://localhost:3000.

These steps should give you a good starting point for pulling and running the code in this repository. Of course, the specifics of how you run the code will depend on your environment, but this should give you an idea of the basic steps involved.
